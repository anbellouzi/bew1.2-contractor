Idea Proposal for Anas Bellouzi

Idea: Edible oil website that allows users to purchase top grade oil from online suppliers.
    Oil is a big international industry. Argan oil is a plant oil produced from the kernels of the argan tree (Argania spinosa L.) that is endemic to Morocco. In Morocco, argan oil is used to dip bread in at breakfast or to drizzle on couscous or pasta. It is also used for cosmetic purposes.
